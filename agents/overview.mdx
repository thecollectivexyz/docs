## What Are Agents?

Agents in NTS Vortex are specialized AI assistants that you can customize for specific tasks or departments. Think of them as pre-configured AI helpers that come with built-in knowledge, personality, and capabilities tailored to particular use cases.

## Agent Components

Every agent has several configurable components:

  <img src="/images/placeholders/agents/agent-components.png" alt="Agent configuration showing different components" />
</Frame>

### 1. Name and Description

The agent's name and a brief description of what it does. This helps users know when to use each agent.

**Examples:**
- "NTS Policy Assistant" - Answers questions about company policies
- "Dispatch Helper" - Assists with logistics and routing questions
- "HR Support Bot" - Helps with human resources inquiries

### 2. System Prompt

The system prompt is the most important part of an agent. It's a set of instructions that tells the AI:
- What role to play
- What information to focus on
- How to respond
- What to avoid

<Tip>
A well-written system prompt is the key to a useful agent. Spend time crafting clear, specific instructions.
</Tip>

### 3. Model Selection

Choose which AI model the agent should use. Different models have different strengths:

| Model Type | Best For |
|------------|----------|
| GPT-4 | Complex reasoning, nuanced responses |
| Claude | Long documents, careful analysis |
| GPT-3.5 | Quick responses, simple tasks |
| Mistral | Fast, efficient responses |

### 4. Knowledge Base

Connect documents and files to your agent so it can reference specific information when answering questions. This is how you give an agent "memory" of your company's documents.

### 5. Tools (Advanced)

Some agents can be given tools to perform specific actions, like searching the web or performing calculations. This is an advanced feature.
