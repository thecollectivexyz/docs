## Creating a New Collection

Before uploading documents, create a collection to organize them:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Knowledge">
    Click on **Workspace** in the sidebar, then select **Knowledge** or **Knowledge Base**.

  <Step title="Create new collection">
    Click the **+ Create** or **New Knowledge** button on the top right.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter collection details">
    Fill in the collection information:
    
    - **Name**: A clear, descriptive name (e.g., "Employee Policies")
    - **Description**: Brief explanation of what documents this collection contains

    <Frame caption="Collection details form">
      <img src="/images/placeholders/knowledge-base/collection-details.png" alt="Form for entering collection name and description" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the upload">
    Check that your document appears in the collection list and shows as processed.

## Uploading Multiple Documents

You can upload several documents at once:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select multiple files">
    When browsing for files, hold **Ctrl** (Windows) or **Command** (Mac) and click to select multiple files.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload all at once">
    All selected files will be uploaded and processed.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
For large batches of documents, upload in groups of 10-20 at a time to ensure smooth processing.
</Tip>

## Managing Documents

### Viewing Document Details

Click on a document to see its details:

<Frame caption="Document details view">
  <img src="/images/placeholders/knowledge-base/document-details.png" alt="Document details showing metadata and preview" />
</Frame>

You can see:
- File name and type
- Upload date
- Processing status
- Size and chunk count

### Deleting Documents

To remove a document:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the delete option">
    Click on the document or hover over it to find the delete button (usually a trash icon).

    <Frame caption="Delete document option">
      <img src="/images/placeholders/knowledge-base/delete-document.png" alt="Delete button on document" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Deleting a document removes it from the knowledge base immediately. Agents will no longer be able to reference it.
</Warning>

### Updating Documents

To update a document with a new version:

1. Delete the old version
2. Upload the new version with the same name

<Tip>
Keep document names consistent when updating so it's easy to track versions.
</Tip>

    Click on the collection you want to rename.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit the name">
    Change the name and save.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Deleting Collections

<Warning>

  <Step title="Find delete option">
    In the collection settings, look for a delete option.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips for Success

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use searchable PDFs">
    Documents created directly as PDFs (not scanned) work best. If you have scanned documents, use [Mistral OCR](/knowledge-base/mistral-ocr) to make them searchable.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep documents focused">
    Instead of one massive document, consider breaking content into logical sections. This helps the AI find relevant information faster.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use clear file names">
    Name files descriptively: `2024-Employee-Handbook.pdf` is better than `document1.pdf`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Organize by topic">
    Group related documents in the same collection. This makes it easier to connect the right knowledge to agents.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review regularly">
    Set a reminder to review your knowledge base quarterly. Remove outdated documents and add new ones.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Document won't upload">
    - Check the file size (very large files may have limits)
    - Verify the file type is supported
    - Try converting to PDF
    - Check your internet connection
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Processing takes too long">
    - Large documents take longer to process
    - Wait a few minutes and refresh
    - For very large documents, consider splitting into smaller files
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI can't find information from document">
    - Verify the document was processed successfully
    - Check that the collection is connected to the agent
    - Try asking questions using specific terms from the document
    - Ensure the document contains searchable text (not just images)
  </Accordion>
