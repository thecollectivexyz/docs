## What is OCR?

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is technology that converts images of text into actual searchable text. This is essential for:

- **Scanned documents** - Paper documents that were scanned as images
- **Image-based PDFs** - PDFs created from scans rather than digital text
- **Photos of documents** - Pictures taken of forms, receipts, or other documents

<Info>
NTS Vortex uses Mistral OCR, a powerful AI-based OCR system that can accurately read text from images and complex documents.
</Info>

## Why Use OCR?

Without OCR, the AI cannot read text that's embedded in images. Here's the difference:

| Document Type | Without OCR | With OCR |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Scanned PDF | AI sees only a blank image | AI can read all the text |
| Photo of document | AI cannot search the content | AI can search and reference |
| Image-based form | Content is invisible to search | Fully searchable |

## When to Use Mistral OCR

Use OCR when uploading:

- Documents that were scanned from paper
- PDFs that you can't select text from (try selecting text - if you can't, it needs OCR)
- Photos of documents or whiteboards
- Forms that were filled out and scanned

<Tip>
**Quick test:** Try to highlight and copy text from your PDF. If you can't, the document needs OCR processing.
</Tip>

## Enabling Mistral OCR

Before using OCR, it needs to be configured in your NTS Vortex system:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Admin Settings">
    Go to **Settings** → **Admin Panel** → **Settings**.

    <Frame caption="Navigating to admin settings">
      <img src="/images/placeholders/knowledge-base/admin-settings-ocr.png" alt="Path to admin settings" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Document Processing settings">
    Look for **Documents**, **RAG**, or **Knowledge Base** settings.

    <Frame caption="Document processing settings">
      <img src="/images/placeholders/knowledge-base/document-settings.png" alt="Document processing settings section" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Mistral OCR">
    Find the OCR settings and enable Mistral OCR. You may need to:
    - Toggle the OCR option on
    - Enter a Mistral API key if required
    - Select Mistral as the OCR provider

    <Frame caption="OCR toggle and settings">
      <img src="/images/placeholders/knowledge-base/enable-ocr.png" alt="OCR enable toggle and configuration" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save settings">
    Click **Save** to apply the changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Mistral OCR is now enabled! New document uploads will be processed with OCR when needed.
</Check>

## Uploading Documents with OCR

Once OCR is enabled, processing happens automatically:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload your document">
    Upload your scanned document normally through the Knowledge Base.

  </Step>

  <Step title="OCR processing begins">
    NTS Vortex detects that the document contains images and automatically runs OCR.

    <Info>
    OCR processing takes longer than regular text documents. A multi-page scanned document may take 1-3 minutes.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Processing complete">
    Once complete, the document will show as processed. The extracted text is now searchable.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the results">
    Try asking questions about the content to verify OCR worked correctly.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Processing Existing Documents

If you uploaded documents before enabling OCR, you may need to reprocess them:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify documents needing OCR">
    Check documents that aren't returning expected search results. These may need OCR processing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Delete the old document">
    Remove the unprocessed version from the collection.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Re-upload with OCR enabled">
    Upload the document again. With OCR enabled, it will be properly processed.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Tips for Best OCR Results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use high-quality scans">
    - Scan at 300 DPI or higher
    - Ensure good lighting and contrast
    - Keep pages straight and flat
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clean up source documents">
    - Remove staples and paper clips before scanning
    - Use a sheet-fed scanner for consistent quality
    - Check for smudges or marks that could confuse OCR
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider document orientation">
    - Ensure pages are right-side up
    - OCR may struggle with rotated or upside-down pages
    - Some systems can auto-detect orientation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Handle multi-column layouts">
    - Mistral OCR handles columns well, but very complex layouts may have issues
    - Consider simplifying complex documents when possible
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting OCR

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OCR text is garbled or incorrect">
    - Check the original scan quality
    - Try rescanning at higher resolution
    - Verify the correct language is set
    - Some handwritten text may not OCR well
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="OCR processing fails">
    - Check if the Mistral API key is valid
    - Verify your account has OCR credits/quota
    - Try a smaller document to test
    - Check error logs for specific issues
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tables aren't recognized correctly">
    - Complex tables may need manual review
    - Consider extracting table data manually for critical information
    - Mistral generally handles tables well, but very complex layouts may have issues
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Processing is very slow">
    - Large documents take longer
    - High-quality OCR settings are slower
    - Check your internet connection
    - Process during off-peak hours for better performance
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Checking OCR Quality

After processing, verify the OCR quality:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ask specific questions">
    Query the AI about specific information from the document. Can it find and reference the content correctly?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check for common errors">
    Look for:
    - Numbers read incorrectly (0 vs O, 1 vs l)
    - Special characters misread
    - Headers and footers incorrectly processed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review extracted text (if available)">
    Some systems let you view the extracted text. Review it for accuracy.

    <Frame caption="Viewing extracted text">
      <img src="/images/placeholders/knowledge-base/view-extracted.png" alt="Viewing the text extracted by OCR" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>
