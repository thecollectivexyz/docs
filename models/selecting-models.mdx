## Overview

NTS Vortex can connect to many AI models, but not all need to be available to every user. This guide explains how to manage which models are visible and set availability.

## Understanding Model Options

Different AI models have different strengths. Thanks to OpenRouter, you can offer the best models from every major provider:

| Model Type            | Strengths                | Best For                      | Cost       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------- |
| **GPT-4o**            | Versatile, reasoning     | Daily tasks, complex queries  | Medium     |
| **GPT-4o-mini**       | Speed, efficiency        | Simple tasks, quick answers   | Low        |
| **o1-preview**        | Advanced Reasoning       | Math, Science, Hard Problems  | High       |
| **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** | Coding, writing, nuance  | Development, content creation | Medium     |
| **Claude 3 Haiku**    | Fast, conversational     | Quick summaries, chat         | Low        |
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro**    | Long context (2M tokens) | Analyzing large documents     | Medium     |
| **Mistral Large 2**   | Multilingual, reasoning  | European languages, logic     | Medium     |
| **Perplexity Sonar**  | Real-time search         | Fact-checking, current events | Low-Medium |
| **DeepSeek V3**       | Coding, general          | Software development, math    | Low        |

## Enabling and Disabling Models

Control which models users can see:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to models list">
    Clock models in the left sidebar inside the admin panel.
  </Step>

    <Step title="Find the model">
    Locate the model you want to enable or disable in the models list.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Toggle visibility">
    Click the toggle or checkbox to enable/disable the model for users.

    </Frame>

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Don't overwhelm users with too many options. Enable 3-5 well-chosen models
  that cover different use cases (e.g., one fast model, one reasoning model, one
  coding model).
</Tip>

## Recommended Model Configurations

We recommend enabling a diverse set of models to give employees the best tool for every job.

### OpenAI Models (General Purpose & Reasoning)

- **GPT-4o**: The current state-of-the-art flagship. Excellent at reasoning, following instructions, and general knowledge.
- **GPT-4o-mini**: The best cost-to-performance ratio. Use this as your **default model** for everyday tasks.
- **o1-mini / o1-preview**: Specialized "reasoning" models. Great for math, logic puzzles, and complex planning (slower, but deeper thinking).

### Anthropic Models (Coding & Writing)

- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: widely considered the best for **coding** and **nuanced writing**. It feels very "human" and follows complex formatting instructions perfectly.
- **Claude 3 Opus**: The previous flagship, still excellent for very long, complex creative writing tasks.
- **Claude 3 Haiku**: extremely fast and cheap, great for simple summarization.

### Google Models (Long Context)

- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Features a massive context window (up to 2M tokens). Perfect for analyzing entire books, large codebases, or long PDF reports.
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: A faster, lighter version of Pro.

### Meta & Open Source (Uncensored & Efficient)

- **Llama 3.1 70B**: A very strong, efficient all-rounder.

### Search & Special Purpose

- **Perplexity Llama 3.1 Sonar (Online)**: Excellent for questions requiring **real-time internet access** and up-to-date citations.

## Organizing Models

### Custom Display Names

You can customize how models appear to users to make them easier to understand:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Edit model settings">
    Click on a model to edit its settings.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set display name">
    Change the display name to something user-friendly:
    - "gpt-4o" → "GPT-4o (Best Overall)"
    - "claude-3-5-sonnet" → "Claude Sonnet (Coding Expert)"
    - "llama-3.1-sonar-large-online" → "Web Search"
  
  </Step>
</Steps>
