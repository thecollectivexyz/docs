## Image Generation Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Writing effective prompts">
    Good prompts lead to better images:
    
    **Basic prompt:**
    > "A truck"
    
    **Better prompt:**
    > "A modern red semi-truck driving on a desert highway at golden hour, professional photography style, high detail"
    
    Include:
    - Subject description
    - Setting/background
    - Style or mood
    - Quality descriptors
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Professional use tips">
    For business materials:
    - Specify "professional" or "corporate" style
    - Request "clean" or "minimalist" designs
    - Mention intended use (presentation, report, etc.)
    - Ask for specific color schemes if needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Iterating on results">
    If the first result isn't quite right:
    - Ask for modifications: "Make it more vibrant"
    - Request variations: "Show me 3 different versions"
    - Be more specific: "Change the background to blue"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Content Guidelines

<Warning>
  AI image generation should be used responsibly. Ensure generated images:
  - Are appropriate for workplace use
  - Don't infringe on trademarks or copyrights
  - Align with NTS brand and values
</Warning>

Most AI image generators have content filters that prevent:

- Inappropriate content
- Copyrighted characters/logos
- Real people's likenesses

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Image generation not working">
    - Verify image generation is enabled in settings
    - Check that the API key is valid
    - Ensure you have credits/quota remaining
    - Try a simpler prompt
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Images are low quality">
    - Check quality settings (switch to HD if available)
    - Use larger image sizes
    - Write more detailed prompts
    - Try a different model
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Request rejected">
    - The prompt may have triggered content filters
    - Try rephrasing the request
    - Remove any potentially problematic terms
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Generation takes too long">
    - Higher quality settings take longer
    - Larger sizes take longer
    - Try standard quality for faster results
    - Check your internet connection
