description: "Keep NTS Vortex up to date by updating the Docker container to the latest version"
---

## Why Update?

Regular updates ensure you have:

- The latest features and improvements
- Security patches and bug fixes
- Better performance and stability
- Access to new AI capabilities

<Tip>
We recommend checking for updates at least once a month or whenever new features are announced.
</Tip>

## Before You Begin

<Warning>
Updating NTS Vortex will briefly make the system unavailable (usually less than 5 minutes). Plan updates during low-usage periods when possible.
</Warning>

Make sure you have:

- Access to your Hostinger VPS ([see VPS access guide](/server-management/hostinger-vps))
- About 10-15 minutes of time
- Notified your team about the brief downtime (optional but recommended)

## Update Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to your VPS">
    Access your VPS using the browser terminal or SSH. See the [Hostinger VPS guide](/server-management/hostinger-vps) if you need help connecting.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to the NTS Vortex directory">
    Change to the directory where NTS Vortex is installed. This is typically:

    ```bash
    cd /opt/open-webui
    ```

    Or it might be in your home directory:

    ```bash
    cd ~/open-webui
    ```

    <Info>
    If you're unsure of the location, contact your IT administrator for the correct path.
    </Info>

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pull the latest Docker image">
    Download the newest version of NTS Vortex by running:

    ```bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
    ```

    This command downloads the latest version. You'll see progress as files are downloaded.

    <Frame caption="Docker pulling the latest image">
      <img src="/images/placeholders/server-management/docker-pull.png" alt="Terminal showing Docker pull progress" />
    </Frame>

    Wait for the process to complete. You'll see "Status: Downloaded newer image" or "Status: Image is up to date" when finished.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Stop the current container">
    Stop the running NTS Vortex container:

    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

    Or if you're using the older docker-compose command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

    <Frame caption="Docker container stopped">
      <img src="/images/placeholders/server-management/docker-down.png" alt="Terminal showing container stopped" />
    </Frame>

    <Warning>
    NTS Vortex is now offline. Complete the remaining steps promptly to minimize downtime.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the updated container">
    Start NTS Vortex with the new version:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    Or with the older command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    The `-d` flag runs the container in the background.

    <Frame caption="Docker container started with new version">
      <img src="/images/placeholders/server-management/docker-up.png" alt="Terminal showing container started" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the update">
    Check that NTS Vortex is running:

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

    You should see the open-webui container listed with a status of "Up".

      <img src="/images/placeholders/server-management/docker-ps.png" alt="Terminal showing running Docker containers" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test in your browser">
    Open NTS Vortex in your web browser and verify everything is working correctly.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
NTS Vortex has been successfully updated to the latest version!

    If you see "command not found" for Docker, it may need to be installed or the path may be different. Contact your IT administrator.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission denied errors">
    Try adding `sudo` before your commands:
    
    ```bash
    sudo docker compose down
    sudo docker compose up -d
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Container won't start">
    Check the logs for errors:

    docker logs open-webui
    ```
    
    If you see errors, note them down and contact your IT administrator.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Website not loading after update">
    - Wait 1-2 minutes for the container to fully start
    - Try clearing your browser cache

## Automatic Updates (Optional)

For automatic updates, your IT team can set up Watchtower or a similar tool. This is an advanced configuration that should be handled by technical staff.
