## Overview

Updating NTS Vortex ensures you have the latest features, security patches, and performance improvements. Since your instance is managed via Coolify, the update process is simple and performed entirely in your browser.

## Update Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Coolify">
    Log in to your Coolify dashboard (see [Accessing Hostinger VPS](/server-management/hostinger-vps) for details).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select the Project">
    Click on the project that contains your NTS Vortex installation.

  </Step> 

  <Step title="Select the Resource">
    Locate and click on the **NTS Vortex** (or Open WebUI) resource within your project environment.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Redeploy with Latest Changes">
    To update to the latest version:
    1. Click the **Advanced** button in the top right corner.
    2. Select **Force Redeploy** (or **Pull latest images & restart**).
    
    This ensures that Coolify pulls the absolute latest version of the application image before restarting.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Deployment">
    You can watch the deployment logs in real-time as the new version is downloaded and started. The process usually takes a few minutes.
    
    Once the status shows **Running** (usually a green indicator), the update is complete.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Update">
    Go to your NTS Vortex URL in a new tab and check that the application loads correctly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If you need to update to a specific version instead of the latest, you can modify the **Image Tag** in the Configuration tab before redeploying.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Deployment Failed">
    If the deployment fails, check the **Build Logs** tab in Coolify to see the error message. Common issues include temporary network glitches or configuration errors. Try redeploying again.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Service Unreachable">
    If the service doesn't come back up after deployment, ensure the health checks are passing in the Coolify dashboard. You may need to wait a minute or two for the application to fully start.
