## Overview

Your NTS Vortex instance is hosted on a Hostinger VPS (Virtual Private Server) and managed using **Coolify**, a self-hosted platform that simplifies server management.

As an administrator, you don't need to use a terminal or command line. You can manage everything directly through your web browser using the Coolify dashboard.

<Warning>
Access to the server management dashboard should be restricted to authorized administrators only.
</Warning>

## Accessing the Coolify Dashboard

To manage your NTS Vortex server, you'll log in to the Coolify interface running on your VPS.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your Server IP">
    You should have received the IP address for your server from your NTS IT administrator.
    
    If you have access to the Hostinger account:
    1. Log in to [hpanel.hostinger.com](https://hpanel.hostinger.com)
    2. Go to **VPS** and select your server
    3. Copy the **IP Address** shown in the overview
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Coolify in Browser">
    Open your web browser and navigate to your server's IP address.
    
    Usually, this will be: `http://<your-ip-address>:8000`
    
    (Replace `<your-ip-address>` with the actual IP, e.g., `http://123.456.78.90:8000`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Log in">
    Enter your Coolify email and password.
    
    <Info>
    If you don't have login credentials, please contact your main administrator to create an account for you.
