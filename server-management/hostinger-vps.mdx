## Overview

NTS Vortex runs on a Hostinger VPS (Virtual Private Server). As an administrator, you may need to access the server to perform maintenance tasks, update the system, or modify configuration settings.

<Warning>
Server access should only be used when necessary. Most day-to-day administration tasks can be done through the NTS Vortex web interface.
</Warning>

## What You'll Need

Before accessing the server, make sure you have:

- Your Hostinger account login credentials
- Your VPS IP address
- SSH access credentials (username and password or SSH key)

<Info>
If you don't have these credentials, contact your NTS IT administrator.
