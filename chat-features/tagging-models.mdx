## Overview

In NTS Vortex, you can tag specific AI models or agents using the **@** symbol. This is similar to tagging people in messaging apps, but you're tagging AI assistants instead.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="See the suggestions">
    A dropdown appears showing available options:
    - AI models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
    - Custom agents you've created
    - Any other available assistants

      <img src="/images/placeholders/chat-features/ai-dropdown.png" alt="Dropdown showing available AI models and agents" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select or type the name">
    Either:
    - Click on a suggestion to select it
    - Continue typing to filter the list

    <Frame caption="Filtering suggestions">
      <img src="/images/placeholders/chat-features/filter-ai.png" alt="Typing to filter AI suggestions" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write your message">
    After the tag, write your question or request.

    <Frame caption="Complete message with tag">

    </Frame>

    Example: `@Claude Can you help me summarize this shipping policy?`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send your message">
    Press **Enter** or click send. The tagged AI will respond.

## Tagging in Different Contexts

### In Private Chats

In your personal conversations, tagging lets you switch between AI models easily:

<Frame caption="Tagging in private chat">
  <img src="/images/placeholders/chat-features/private-tagging.png" alt="Tagging AI in a private conversation" />
</Frame>

You might:
- Ask GPT-4 for creative writing
- Switch to Claude for document analysis
- Use a specialized agent for NTS-specific questions

### In Channels

In team channels, tagging is how you bring AI into the conversation:

<Frame caption="Tagging in channel">
  <img src="/images/placeholders/chat-features/channel-tagging.png" alt="Tagging AI in a team channel" />
</Frame>

Example conversation:
> **You:** @GPT-4 Can you help us draft a response to this customer complaint about delayed shipping?
>
> **GPT-4:** [AI responds with draft]
>
> **Colleague:** @GPT-4 Can you make it more apologetic?
>
> **GPT-4:** [AI provides revised version]

### Multiple Tags

You can tag multiple AIs in one message to compare responses:

<Frame caption="Multiple tags">
  <img src="/images/placeholders/chat-features/multiple-tags.png" alt="Message with multiple AI tags" />
</Frame>

Example: `@GPT-4 @Claude How would you approach scheduling this shipment?`

Both models will respond, and you can compare their suggestions.

## Tagging Custom Agents

If you have custom agents set up, you can tag them the same way:

<Frame caption="Tagging custom agent">
  <img src="/images/placeholders/chat-features/tag-custom-agent.png" alt="Tagging a custom NTS agent" />
</Frame>

Examples:
- `@NTS-Policy-Expert What's our policy on hazmat shipments?`
- `@Dispatch-Helper How should we route this heavy haul?`
- `@HR-Assistant What are the vacation request procedures?`

<Tip>
Custom agents are great for questions about specific NTS topics since they have specialized knowledge and instructions.
</Tip>

## Common Tagging Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Getting help with a task">
    ```
    @GPT-4 I need to write an email to a customer about a delayed shipment. 
    The shipment number is 12345 and it's 2 days late due to weather.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Analyzing information">
    ```
    @Claude Here's the route data for this week. Can you identify any 
    patterns or areas for improvement?
    [paste data]
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Answering policy questions">
    ```
    @NTS-Policy-Expert What's the maximum weight limit for flatbed shipments 
    going through California?
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Drafting communications">
    ```
    @GPT-4 Draft a professional response to this carrier inquiry about 
    our freight rates.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Getting quick calculations">
    ```
    @GPT-4 If a truck averages 55 mph and needs to travel 780 miles, 
    how long will the journey take including a 30-minute rest stop?
    ```

## Best Practices

### Choosing the Right AI

| Situation | Recommended |
|-----------|-------------|
| Complex analysis | GPT-4 or Claude |
| Quick questions | GPT-4-mini or Claude Haiku |
| NTS-specific questions | Custom NTS agents |
| Creative writing | GPT-4 |
| Document summaries | Claude |

### Writing Good Prompts

When tagging AI, be specific:

**Less effective:**
> @GPT-4 Help with shipping

**More effective:**
> @GPT-4 I need to calculate the shipping cost for a 2,500 lb load from Miami to Seattle. What information do you need to provide an estimate?

### Context in Channels

In channels, provide enough context since others are watching:

**Good:**
> @Claude We're discussing the Smith account shipment. Can you suggest three ways to optimize the routing from Dallas to Chicago?

This helps:
- The AI understand the context
- Other team members follow the conversation
- Future reference when reviewing history

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI not responding to tag">
    - Make sure the @ is immediately before the model name
    - Verify the model/agent is available
    - Check for typos in the name
    - Try refreshing the page
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Model not appearing in suggestions">
    - The model may not be enabled for your account
    - Check with your administrator
    - Try typing the full name manually
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong AI responding">
    - Be more specific with your tag
    - Make sure you selected the correct suggestion
    - Use the full model name if shortened versions are ambiguous
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Suggestions not showing">
    - Make sure @ is the first character or has a space before it
    - Wait a moment for the dropdown to load
    - Check your internet connection
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
