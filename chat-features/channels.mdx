## What Are Channels?

Channels are shared chat spaces where multiple team members can collaborate together and with AI. Unlike private chats, channels allow:

- Multiple people to participate in the same conversation
- Shared access to AI responses and discussions
- Team collaboration on projects and tasks
- Persistent history everyone can reference
