## What Are Channels?

Channels are shared chat spaces where multiple team members can collaborate together and with AI. Unlike private chats, channels allow:

- Multiple people to participate in the same conversation
- Shared access to AI responses and discussions
- Team collaboration on projects and tasks
- Persistent history everyone can reference

## Channel Best Practices

  <Accordion title="Create purpose-specific channels">
    Create channels for specific teams or topics:
    - #dispatch-team
    - #hr-questions
    - #it-support
    - #general
    
    This keeps conversations organized and easy to find.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set clear expectations">
    In the channel description, explain:
    - What the channel is for
    - Who should join
    - Any guidelines for use

  <Accordion title="Use private channels appropriately">
    Private channels are good for:

    - Small project teams
    - Department-specific topics
    
    Use public channels when possible for transparency.

  <Accordion title="Archive inactive channels">
    Instead of deleting, consider archiving channels that are no longer active. This preserves history while reducing clutter.
  </Accordion>
